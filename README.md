# Overview
The AMBA APB4 Protocol project implements the Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) protocol, part of the AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) family. This protocol is designed to offer a low-complexity, low-power interface for communication with peripherals in modern System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. It is particularly suited for connecting low-speed peripherals such as timers, UARTs, GPIOs, and configuration registers, where high performance is not required.
